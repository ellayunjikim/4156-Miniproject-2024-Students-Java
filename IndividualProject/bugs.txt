Keeping track of bugs to fix:

`Course.java`
- ennrollStudent(): always returns false (need to check if student can enroll (capacity))
- dropStudent(): always returns false (need to check if there is a student to drop (number of enrolled students not 0))
- isCourseFull(): should be opposite logic
- getCourseLocation(): returns instructor name instead of course locaion
- getInstructorName(): returns course locaion instead of instructor name

`Department.java`
- Line 37: getNumberOfMajors() return value should not be negative.
- Line 46: getDepartmentChair() return value should be not quotation marked.
- Line 69: If number of people in major is 0, should not drop to -1. 
- Line 110: toString() return value should be not quotation marked.
