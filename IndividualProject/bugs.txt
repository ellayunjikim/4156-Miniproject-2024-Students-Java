Keeping track of bugs to fix:

`Course.java`
- ennrollStudent(): always returns false (need to check if student can enroll (capacity))
- dropStudent(): always returns false (need to check if there is a student to drop (number of enrolled students not 0))
- isCourseFull(): should be opposite logic
- getCourseLocation(): returns instructor name instead of course locaion
- getInstructorName(): returns course locaion instead of instructor name
